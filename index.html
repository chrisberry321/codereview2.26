        <h3>Sunday Brunch: Japanese Inspired Avocado Toast</h3>
        <p>
          It’s Sunday! You know what that means: it’s time for Sunday Brunch. Why don’t you skip the line and make brunch at home this week? The coffee’s truly bottomless, the booze doesn’t have a crazy markup and you can chill out in your pajamas. Every Sunday I’ll post a brunch recipe. Soon you won’t be asking, where should we go for brunch – instead it’ll be, what should we make for brunch today?

        <h3>Friday Finds: 2.12.16</h3>
        <p>
          What a crazy week it’s been! It was the Super Bowl, Chinese New Year, and Valentine’s is coming up. I recently started taking pottery class and I’ve been beyond busy. Pottery class is so much fun. I’ve always liked crazy people with coding skills.
