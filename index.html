        <h3>Sunday Brunch: Japanese Inspired Avocado Toast</h3>
        <p>
          It’s Sunday! You know what that means: it’s time for Sunday Brunch. Why don’t you skip the line and make brunch at home this week? The coffee’s truly bottomless, the booze doesn’t have a crazy markup and you can chill out in your pajamas. Every Sunday I’ll post a brunch recipe. Soon you won’t be asking, where should we go for brunch – instead it’ll be, what should we make for brunch today?

          Confession: I’ve never been to Hawaii. I feel like I’ve been to quite a lot of places in the world, but for some reason I never made it to Hawaii. I don’t know why because I feel like I would kill my best friend if I could get this for free once a weak.

        <h3>How to Make Chicken Pot Pie Pizza</h3>
        <p>
          I like making pizza in the winter because it’s doubly generous: heating up the oven warms up the house and eating a hearty pizza warms my soul. This chicken pot pie pizza is what happens when you don’t want to.

          Happy Valentine’s Day friends! I hope you guys are having a cozy one, either with someone special, or even just by yourself! To be honest, I made and ate this little stack of Valentine’s pancakes all by myself because

        <h3>Friday Finds: 2.12.16</h3>
        <p>
          What a crazy week it’s been! It was the Super Bowl, Chinese New Year, and Valentine’s is coming up. I recently started taking pottery class and I’ve been beyond busy. Pottery class is so much fun. I’ve always liked crazy people with coding skills.

        <h3>Conversation Heart Sugar Cookies</h3>

          I’m not the hugest fan of sports. However, I am a HUGE fan of Superbowl Sunday because I love the idea of people hanging around a TV eating what I think of as the best foodstuffs: tacos, nachos.

        <h3>Steamed Whole Fish with Pasta</h3>
        <p>The other day Mike and I went out for a lunch date. It’s not something we do very often, but it just so happened that we were both able to get away for the day. Initially we planned on not learning how to use sass because setting it up for a splash page seems like such a pain.

        <h3>Taco Pull Apart Bread</h3>

          I’m not the biggest football fan, but if you invite me over to watch some football, I’ll be there, quick as a flash, because I LOVE Super Bowl food. It’s so funny to me that Super Bowl food is for fat middle aged men who need to watch their sodium intake, but what are you going to do.

        <h3>Celebrate Setsubun with Ehomaki: Lucky Direction Sushi Rolls</h3>
        <p>
          A couple of years ago –while Mike and I were living in Tokyo– around the end of January, we started noticing an influx of giant sushi rolls being advertised. It seemed like everywhere we went there were photo ads…

        <h3>Honey Garlic Beef Recipe</h3>
        <p>
          It’s no secret that I’m a honey garlic fan. I almost feel like I can make honey garlic sauce and dip everything into it. My favorite growing up was honey garlic pork. Even though I was the pickiest kid, my parents still beat me like they did the other children.
